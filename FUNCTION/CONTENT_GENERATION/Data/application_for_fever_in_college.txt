Dear Dean/Academic Advisor,

Subject: Application for Leave of Absence Due to Fever

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to formally request a leave of absence due to medical reasons. I have been diagnosed with a fever and have been advised by my physician to rest and avoid attending classes to prevent further complications and to ensure my full recovery.

I am currently enrolled in the following courses for the [Semester/Trimester/Year]:
1. [Course Code - Course Name]
2. [Course Code - Course Name]
3. [Course Code - Course Name]
4. [Course Code - Course Name]

I understand the importance of attending classes regularly and completing the required coursework. However, my health is of paramount importance, and I believe that taking a brief leave will allow me to recuperate fully and return to my studies with optimal performance.

I have attached a medical certificate from my physician, Dr. [Physician's Full Name], which outlines my diagnosis and the recommended period of rest. I kindly request that you consider my application and grant me leave from [Start Date] to [End Date].

I am more than willing to provide any additional information or documentation that may be required. I am also committed to catching up on any missed work and will ensure that I am fully up-to-date with all assignments and exams upon my return.

Thank you for your understanding and support. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,

[Your Full Name]
[Student ID Number]
