Dear [Recipient's Name],

I am writing to formally request medical leave from my academic responsibilities at [College/University Name] due to a recent onset of fever. I am currently enrolled in the following courses:

1. [Course Name 1] - [Course Code]
2. [Course Name 2] - [Course Code]
3. [Course Name 3] - [Course Code]

I have been diagnosed with a fever by a medical professional, and I have been advised to rest and avoid public places for the next [number of days] days to facilitate full recovery and prevent the spread of any potential illness. I have attached a copy of my medical certificate for your reference.

During my absence, I kindly request the following accommodations:

1. **Assignments and Coursework:** If possible, I would appreciate it if you could provide me with a brief overview of any assignments or coursework that I have missed, so I can catch up upon my return.
2. **Lectures and Tutorials:** If my classes are recording sessions, I would like permission to access the recordings to stay updated with the course materials.
3. **Extension of Submission Dates:** If there are any assignments or projects due during my leave, I would appreciate an extension to submit them after my return.

I understand that my absence may disrupt the class schedule, and I apologize for any inconvenience caused. I am more than willing to compensate for any missed work upon my return to ensure that my grades are not adversely affected.

I have informed my classmates and will keep them updated about my situation. I am also reachable via email or phone for any urgent matters related to my courses.

Thank you for understanding and considering my request. I look forward to your positive response.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
